[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/baransu/graphql_ppx_re.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/baransu/graphql_ppx_re)

This project builds upon [graphql_ppx](https://github.com/mhallin/graphql_ppx). At this points it's basiclly original OCaml code reformated to Reason with small adjustments to build process.

Right now I don't focus on Native Reason. If you want to help, PRs welcome.
